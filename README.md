# Road_Accident_Analysis_on_Excel

This data I pulled from one of Youtube tutorial and then cleanned and preapred data for my analysis.

First I created a pivot table to have an idea about the accident trend.

and then after creating a multiple KPIs I prepared an interactive dashboard which can be filtered using Timeline and Slicer I have on dashboard.
